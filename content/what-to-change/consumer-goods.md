content = "People should never have to work in inhumane conditions just so we can have cheaper clothes, food or gadgets, but this is happening every single day. 1 in 185 people live in modern slavery today, and nothing will change unless the indifference of companies, workers and consumers changes. Looked at another way, all those who participate in the production of goods should have a share in the wealth they generate.\n\nThere are many consumer goods with long supply chains which are known to be significant contributors to human rights abuses or very poor working conditions. Many also contribute to environmental issues such as deforestation. Low-cost clothing, fish and lithium ion batteries for phones and laptops are just some examples of goods with particular high risks."

answer = "* Does your company have a code of conduct for its supply chains? How stringently is it upheld?\n* Can your company trace the raw materials for its products back to their origins (i.e. beyond just their direct supplier)?\n* Does your company’s supply chain operate in any particularly “at risk” regions?"

answer = "_Fashion -_ “[The True Cost](https://truecostmovie.com/)” documentary provides a good introduction to some of the issues within the fashion industry, while the Clean Clothes Campaign has a range of [resources](https://cleanclothes.org/resources/recommended-reading), global and region-specific. Fashion Revolution has a [manifesto](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/manifesto/) for how the fashion industry needs to change (which workers can sign), and produces a transparency [ranking](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/) of the world’s 250 largest fashion brands every year. KnowTheChain also produces a [ranking](https://knowthechain.org/benchmark/?ranking_year=2018&ranking_sector=apparel-footwear), focused on actual company behaviour, rather than transparency alone.\n\n_Food and beverages_ - These supply chains cut across human rights, environmental degradation and animal welfare issues. [Fairtrade](https://www.fairtrade.net/issue) explains these issues within a range of these supply chains, while the [BHRRC](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/search-topics) tackles issues including fish and wine. BBFAW compares business practices on animal welfare in an annual [report](https://bbfaw.com/publications/)."

content = "The generally desired goal of a circular economy is some way off, but some product cycles are particularly short-lived, contributing to environmental degradation (not to mention poor consumer outcomes). “Fast fashion” is a particular example of this, while on the other end of the spectrum is the practice of high-end fashion producers burning unsold stock to preserve their brand value.\n\nFood waste is one of the most urgent problems in this area; around one-third of food produced is thrown away, including by supermarkets and retailers, at a time when so many go hungry.\n\nIn addition to the main product itself, so many products are wrapped in unnecessary packaging, which ends up in landfill or shipped around the world. Our planet is choking on plastics; let’s not use them unless we have to."
