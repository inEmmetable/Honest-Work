content = "Climate change is one of the biggest collective threats our planet has faced, and virtually all companies contribute to it in some way, primarily through their own emissions but also by, for example, providing finance to fossil fuel projects. While companies are beginning to wake up to the need to reduce their emissions, this is not happening at nearly the pace necessary / the commitments being made to cut their emissions is not nearly ambitious enough to avert high levels of warming and the disasters that will accompany it.\n\nAll companies should aim to become carbon neutral; this can limit the effects of global warming while driving down the costs of renewables for everyone, saving companies money over time. That said, 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988. Is your company one of them? Perhaps one of their suppliers? Maybe you can help find a solution."

Does it have a credible plan to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions on a sufficiently urgent timeline?\n* Does your company provide services to any major emitters? Does it have a policy prohibiting business relations with companies that fail to contribute to climate solutions?\n* Does your company contribute to climate change through its supply chain, perhaps through indirect emissions or deforestation?"

answer = "_What you need to know -_ For a basic introduction to climate change and answers to some FAQs, TED has put together a list of [resources](https://countdown.ted.com/get-informed/) and some of their famous talks which can provide you with information and inspiration.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ While we need to start rapidly reducing our reliance on all fossil fuels, this is most urgent for coal - inefficient, heavily polluting, heavy emitting. No new coal is a prerequisite, and accelerating getting rid of coal is priority\n\n_The big contributors_ - Energy companies are obviously the most significant [contributors](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf) to climate change \\[link\\]. Banks and investors have a strong enabling role in the activities in which energy companies can engage \\[link to Finance\\]. Beyond these, several technology solutions that have emerged in recent years emit high levels of emissions, such as data centres for cloud computing, blockchain services, and [ride-hailing apps](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ride-hailing-climate-risks) like Uber. Supply chains that contribute to deforestation also play a role, such as those for palm oil (found in around [50%](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/8-things-know-about-palm-oil) of packaged products in supermarkets).\n\n_Looking out for vulnerable workers_ - Abandoning coal (and other fossil fuels) should not mean abandoning coal workers - companies and governments need to have plans for a just transition for workers to ensure they are guaranteed good jobs that don’t rely on fossil fuels."
