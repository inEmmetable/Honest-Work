      Honest Work is founded on the belief that most people, if given the choice, would prefer to do the right thing.

      In our workplaces, that can seem like a luxury that’s not always afforded to us. We have to work to live, and it sometimes feels that truly good corporate citizens are few and far between. Particularly if you want to work for big international companies, it can seem difficult to find ones that aren’t contributing to global problems in some way, be it climate change, human rights abuses or tax evasion.

      A big reason for this is that corporate decision-making is primarily set by senior management and shareholders. These groups tend to have an extreme focus on profitability, and are wealthy enough to avoid dealing with the negative consequences of that focus. These companies would likely be run in a more humane way if workers had more of a say.

      Of course, few enough companies are prepared to give their workers that power, and that’s where Honest Work comes in. We want to help you connect with like-minded colleagues at your company to change your workplace for the better and improve the impact it has on the world.

      Our platform is designed to help you change your company in a safe way. First it’s a hub of relevant information and resources around how your company might be contributing to some of the problems in the world today - check out the “What to change” pages \[link\]. If you click on the “Get started” \[link\] button you’ll be able to connect anonymously with other workers at your company and plan how to make change at your company.

      When you’re just one worker at a company that employs thousands, it can seem impossible to change things. But chances are you’re not alone, and together you can make your company, and the world, a better place.
