content = "One measure that workers can take to both improve their protections in the workplace and stand in solidarity with other workers is to join a trade union.\n\nTrade unions are organisations with employees as their members, who join together to maintain and improve their conditions of employment.\n\nTrade unions provide a range of services for their members, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. During campaigns and negotiations, unions often provide legal advice, funding and other forms of support. More broadly, unions also provide various forms of training and professional development throughout a personâ€™s career.\n\nUnions also seek to improve the rights and conditions of workers across the board. They undertake public policy engagement on a number of important topics, and negotiate with industry bodies to raise standards.\n\nFind the right union for you by following the links below:\n\n* [Australia](https://join.australianunions.org.au/)\n* [United Kingdom](https://findyourunion.tuc.org.uk/)\n* [United States](https://www.unionfacts.com/cuf/)"
