content = "Climate change is one of the biggest threats our planet has faced, and virtually all companies contribute to it in some way, primarily through their own emissions but also through the services they offer, for example by providing finance to fossil fuel projects or developing misleading publicity campaigns. Even where companies are waking up to the need to reduce their emissions, many \"net zero\" commitments being made leave out important sources of their emissions, or are not backed up by sufficient urgency or a credible plan.\n\nAll companies should aim to become carbon neutral; this can limit the effects of global warming while driving down the costs of renewables for everyone, saving companies money over time. That said, 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988. Is your company one of them? Perhaps one of their suppliers? Maybe you can help find a solution."

content = "It might seem a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but too often contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nThis problem has been particularly notable during the COVID-19 crisis, as many companies that have benefited from government programmes have been [shown](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-companies-tax-excl/exclusive-u-s-taxpayers-virus-relief-went-to-firms-that-avoided-u-s-tax-idUSKBN2341ZE) to have paid little to no corporation tax.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. It doesn't have to be this way."

content = "Excessive corporate influence over decision-making in politics is a serious problem in many regions of the world. Companies, either directly or through trade associations that they are a member of, donate money to politicians who they perceive as likely to favour their interests (or to push them to do so). Frequently, donations and lobbying activities run [counter](https://politicalaccountability.net/hifi/files/Conflicted-Consequences.pdf) to the declared beliefs of those same companies - for example, companies that are climate champions in public but privately donate funds to climate deniers or lobby to water down public interest regulations.\n\nOn donations specifically, there is a question whether corporate money has any place in the political system at all, but there can be little doubt that there is too much of it there at the moment. In the US, the top 10 donors alone in the 2018 election cycle contributed almost half a billion dollars.\n\nThis is not about influencing whether money flows to liberal or conservative parties; this is about eliminating the ability of companies to undermine the public good and decide the outcomes of elections."
