content = "People should never have to work in inhumane or degrading conditions just so we can have cheaper clothes, but this is happening every single day. Most people still remember the Rana Plaza tragedy of 2013, where 1,134 people died. More recently, UK workers in Boohoo’s supply chains were revealed to be earning as little as £3.50 per hour.\n\nFashion has an environmental cost too - the industry emits more than air travel and shipping combined, produces waste water which pollutes rivers and oceans, and when clothing ends up in landfill it often causes harmful chemicals to leech into the earth.\n\nLeaders in the fashion industry have known about these issues for a long time yet failed to take action. Yet it should not only be up to them. If you work for a fashion brand - be it as a buyer, a merchandising assistant, an administrator - you deserve a say in the impact your company has.\n\nSign up below to join a small community of change-minded workers in the fashion industry, and find out how you can help your company do better."
