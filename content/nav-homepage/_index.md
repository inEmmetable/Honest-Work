faq_title: FAQ - Ways to improve employee participation
three_columns___column_one_-_title_: How to make a change?
three_columns___column_one_-_text: Once you’ve identified a change you’d like to try
  and make at your company, where do you begin? Company cultures differ and some issues
  are more sensitive than others, so think carefully about the particular aspects
  of your workplace when seeking to make change. Be aware of the risks of speaking
  up. Need inspiration? Check out what workers have already achieved.
three_columns___column_two_-_title_: Workers changing the world
three_columns___column_two_-_text: History is full of examples of workers coming together
  to stand up for what is right. In 1862, mill workers in Manchester refused to touch
  cotton picked by US slaves. Australian construction workers pioneered “green bans”,
  refusing to build projects that would damage local environments or communities.
  Workers at IBM, Polaroid and others challenged their companies for supplying the
  apartheid South African government.
three_columns___column_three_-_title: Technology
three_columns___column_three-_text: Tech companies operate on the cutting edge of
  innovation, and often venture into new product areas at a pace with which regulation
  cannot be expected to keep up. So it frequently falls to the companies themselves
  to act with care and prudence, and marshall against unforeseen consequences; something
  they have often failed to do.
three_columns_column_three_text: Finance powers the entire economy, and financial
  institutions have major influence over how companies act and what projects get financed.
  It's time they started aligning that influence with the common good.
three_columns_column_one_title: Technology
three_columns_column_one_text: Tech workers have been on the forefront of employee
  activism in recent years. Despite progress, issues with privacy, content moderation
  and an excessive focus on user engagement still plague the industry.
three_columns_column_two_title: Key issues
three_columns_column_two_text: What are the biggest issues facing companies across
  industries that workers can do something about? How's your company faring? Learn
  about your companies' role in relation to climate change, human rights and more.

  degradation, human rights impacts - energy companies have work to do.
three_columns_column_three_text_slide_2: Many workers join the healthcare industry
  to help make the world a healthier place. Yet practices must change to improve access
  to medicine - especially among the world's poorest.

faq_title_one: What is honest work and how employees can change the world?
faq_content_one: |-
  Many of us grow up wanting to make the world a better place.

  That’s not always easy, especially in that place where we spend so much of our time: work. It can be hard to find employers that live up to our values, with so many companies contributing to global problems in some way, be it climate change, human rights abuses or aggressive tax avoidance. And so we feel we have little choice but to keep our head down and get on with things.

  Yet that’s starting to change. Workers in every industry are increasingly coming together and pushing the companies they work for to do better. Workers have been getting their companies to commit to cutting their emissions, stop whitewashing the reputations of controversial clients, and stop stocking dangerous weapons in retailers.

  Honest Work has been set up to help more workers change their companies for the better. Here you can:

faq_title_three: Who can join the Honest Work community?
faq_content_three: |-
  We’re open to all workers who are passionate about making the world a better place. Though to ensure workers feel able to talk freely, we will generally exclude anyone in a management or human resources role, journalists seeking to do reporting on other workers, and those seeking to promote products or services to other members.

  Members will be allowed to remain anonymous on the platform, but we will seek to validate you meet the above requirements during registration. Fair enough?
