content = "Energy companies have often found themselves embroiled in controversial practices during recent decades which continue to have damaging effects on people and planet. While there is increasing awareness of the role energy companies have played in hindering progress on climate change, their broader impacts on communities are still under-appreciated, as is their role in producing packaging waste - just [20 companies](https://www.minderoo.org/plastic-waste-makers-index/data/indices/producers/) produce 55% of the world's plastic waste.\n\nWhile renewable energy is our best hope for the future those companies too must urgently improve their human rights practices if they are to retain their moral legitimacy and social licence."

content = "To get the obvious out of the way: yes, energy companies are among the biggest contributors to climate change, and no, it’s not all their fault. Most of the world’s economies are still dependent on fossil fuels to meet their energy needs, and until that is no longer the case companies will exist to meet that demand.\n\nHowever. Companies can choose to support or obstruct the transition to a low-carbon economy, and all too often they have chosen the latter. Suppressing research on the realities of climate change, running disinformation campaigns, fighting policy measures to curb emissions; these are the ways in which energy companies have helped bring us to the brink of dangerous global warming.\n\nThere are two futures for today’s fossil fuel companies - they can shift their focus and invest in being exclusively renewable energy companies, or they can start to scale down their activities, redirecting money that would have been spent on resource exploration to retraining workers for the jobs of our low-carbon future and supporting their other stakeholders."

answer = "Some general information on climate change is [elsewhere](https://honestwork.org/what-to-change/overview/) on this website. Policy change to mitigate the effects of climate change is to some extent [inevitable](https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=9833); as physical disasters such as the 2019 [Australia fires](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50951043) become more commonplace, inaction will become untenable. But the speed and strength of action is critical, and most energy companies are acting as obstacles. Not only does this mean worse climate change effects down the line, it also means that workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction are more likely to suffer sudden losses of income under policy changes, rather than companies engaging in a managed decline in their extractive operations starting now.\n\nOne necessary part of a credible climate plan is a minimum price for carbon emitted - see [here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-is-a-carbon-price-and-why-do-we-need-one/) for a good explanation. Companies should publicly support a carbon price of at least $100 per tonne of CO2 in developed countries by 2030 at the latest, and likely much sooner. While many fossil fuel companies have backed a [carbon dividend plan](https://clcouncil.org/our-plan/), the proposed price ($40 per tonne) is too low to justify the roll-back of environmental standards they are seeking alongside it.\n\nA number of companies have declared ambitions to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Such commitments are in theory laudable, but the devil is in the details of how net zero is defined and their plan to get there. This [report](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/tpi/publications/58.pdf?type=Publication) sets out how none of the current 2050 goals are aligned with the Paris Agreement, and what would need to change."

Despite this, fossil fuel expansion continues - pages 4-5 of this [report](https://brightnow.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Church-Investments-in-Major-Oil-Companies-Bright-Now-Report-web.pdf) show how several companies are planning increases in oil and gas production.
