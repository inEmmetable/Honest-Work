content = "Finance powers the entire economy; banks, through their lending, and investors, through their holdings, have major influence over how companies act and what projects get financed. Choose any issue from any of these pages; financial sector companies can help fix it, if they choose.\n\nMost of these companies see addressing societal issues as someone else’s responsibility. Banks say it is not their job to dictate outcomes. Passive investors, stock exchanges, index providers and other financial services companies believe their role is to replicate the market and reflect the investable universe rather than enabling money to flow towards companies that contribute to the general good (and tend to lobby against regulatory measures that would encourage this). When it’s no one’s job to prevent negative outcomes, negative outcomes is what you get."

content = "Shareholders exercise greater control over companies than at any other time in history. Yet they have failed to prevent, and have even encouraged, the misdeeds and abuses perpetrated by their investee companies, be it climate change, inequality and the precarisation of work, or human rights abuses. This is despite the fact that most of the money that they manage comes from the pensions of everyday workers, who have an interest not just in a stable retirement income but also in the world in which they live and retire.\n\nThere is increasing recognition of the role of investors in fixing problems generated by portfolio companies; as seen with the explosion in popularity of ESG (environmental, social and governance) investing. But beyond nice marketing too few investors back substantive change, and continue to support companies in plundering public goods as long as it remains profitable to do so.\n\nInvestors have two major ways to influence outcomes for society - how they select the companies they are willing to invest in, and the expectations they set of those companies. For the former, this means ensuring money is directed towards companies and projects that contribute to the collective good, and withheld where it would cause harm. For the latter, this means demanding companies align their activities with the interests of society, and voting against management where they do not."

answer = "What you need to know - The Financial Times’ [Moral Money](https://www.ft.com/moral-money) newsletter is a good resource for the latest updates on sustainable investing. For shareholder voting, [Majority Action](https://www.majorityaction.us/) sets out the key issues to look out for and how the largest asset managers vote on relevant shareholder proposals.\n\nWhat you can ask for - There are a number of relevant initiatives investors in this space can join. For asset owners, the [Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance](https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-alliance/) have pledged to decarbonise their portfolios by 2050. [ClimateAction100+](http://www.climateaction100.org/) is a collection of hundreds of investors engaging the world’s most polluting companies to change their practices. Investors can also support needed policy change such as the [EU taxonomy](https://d8g8t13e9vf2o.cloudfront.net/Uploads/d/s/r/taxonomyinvestorbriefingpostdeal_612580.pdf), which requires investors to disclose the sustainability of their portfolios."

content = "It might be a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. They can choose to take a more reasonable approach."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ A great resource with answers to just about everything is [here](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/). The Tax Justice Network has prepared answers to some FAQs [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/faq/), including why this isn’t an issue just for governments. They also have some suggested actions [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/take-action/).\n\n_The most urgent issue_ - Countries across the globe are damaged by the reduced tax revenues they are able to collect from companies. Yet this is a particular problem for developing countries, who are [estimated](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/tackling-global-tax-havens-shaxon.htm) to miss out on around $200bn in corporate tax revenues per year - that’s greater than the amount they receive in development assistance.\n\n_The big contributors to the problem_ - Some media outlets prepare lists of the biggest tax dodgers in their country, including: [Australia](https://www.michaelwest.com.au/top-40-tax-dodgers-2019/), [UK](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6522913/Almost-1-5-biggest-firms-paid-year-5-got-handout-taxman.html), [US]( https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/). A ranking of global corporate tax havens is [here](https://www.corporatetaxhavenindex.org/introduction/cthi-2019-results).\n\n_What can you ask for -_ An important yet basic step a company can take is [country-by-country reporting](https://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/country-by-country/), where it sets out how much tax it pays in each jurisdiction. This simple transparency allows scrutiny of the company’s tax bill. In the UK, businesses can also get certified with a [Fair Tax Mark](https://fairtaxmark.net/) to indicate they’re paying a reasonable rate of tax."
