    Want to join a community of like-minded employees to chat, share and maybe take action? We might be able to help. Sign up [here]() and once we have a reasonable number of members we'll email you a link to join.

    At the least it might be an opportunity for emotional support, and to get ideas and inspiration for how others are seeking change in their workplaces. And if any of your colleagues join we'll connect you.

    This will be a space for workers only - no senior management, no HR. We'll seek to verify your identity to keep this a safe workers' space. But you can keep your identity hidden from everyone else if you wish.

    Here's how it will work:

  content: You are a person who cares about the state of the world. You work for a
    company; you think maybe they could do a few things better. The company’s leadership
    isn’t taking the issue seriously enough.

  content: But you’re just one person in a company that employs hundreds, or thousands.
    You don’t know where to begin, and you don’t want to risk your job.

  content: Chances are you’re not alone. Plenty of people care about the world and
    want to help make it better. The hard part is finding them.

    Many companies have committees, employee networks or green teams working on issues you care about that any worker can join - this can be a good place to start meeting like-minded colleagues.

    Our community will try to do the same. If you join \[link - Get Started\] Honest Work, you’ll be connected with any other workers at your company who, like you, have said they want to push management to do better. If you're worried about being recognised you can keep your name to yourself.

  content: Together, you can talk about what your company needs to change and how
    to go about making that change happen.

  content: If you need some ideas, you can check out our Issues page \[link - What
    to change, General\] for some of the most pressing problems many companies are
    contributing to, and some rankings of the worst performers.

  content: Once you have your idea and some colleagues onside, you can start collectively
    pushing for change. There are a range of ways to do this - you might raise the
    issue in internal meetings, write to management or the board of directors, unionise,
    even go on strike. We can try and help you find the strategy that works for you.
