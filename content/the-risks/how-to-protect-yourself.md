    One measure that workers can take to both improve their protections in the workplace and stand in solidarity with other workers is to join a trade union.

    Trade unions are organisations with employees as their members, who join together to maintain and improve their conditions of employment.

    Trade unions provide a range of services for their members, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. During campaigns and negotiations, unions often provide legal advice, funding and other forms of support. More broadly, unions also provide various forms of training and professional development throughout a personâ€™s career.

    Unions also seek to improve the rights and conditions of workers across the board. They undertake public policy engagement on a number of important topics, and negotiate with industry bodies to raise standards.
