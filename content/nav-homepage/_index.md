three_columns___column_one_-_title_: How to make a change?
three_columns___column_one_-_text: Once you’ve identified a change you’d like to try
  and make at your company, where do you begin? Company cultures differ and some issues
  are more sensitive than others, so think carefully about the particular aspects
  of your workplace when seeking to make change. Be aware of the risks of speaking
  up. Need inspiration? Check out what workers have already achieved.
three_columns___column_two_-_title_: Workers changing the world
three_columns___column_two_-_text: History is full of examples of workers coming together
  to stand up for what is right. In 1862, mill workers in Manchester refused to touch
  cotton picked by US slaves. Australian construction workers pioneered “green bans”,
  refusing to build projects that would damage local environments or communities.
  Workers at IBM, Polaroid and others challenged their companies for supplying the
  apartheid South African government.

  they have often failed to do.
