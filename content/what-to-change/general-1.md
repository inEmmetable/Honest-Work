content = "Climate change is one of the biggest collective threats our planet has faced, and virtually all companies contribute to it in some way, primarily through their own emissions but also by, for example, providing finance to fossil fuel projects. While companies are beginning to wake up to the need to reduce their emissions, this is not happening at nearly the pace necessary / the commitments being made to cut their emissions is not nearly ambitious enough to avert high levels of warming and the disasters that will accompany it.\n\nAll companies should aim to become carbon neutral; this can limit the effects of global warming while driving down the costs of renewables for everyone, saving companies money over time. That said, 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988. Is your company one of them? Perhaps one of their suppliers? Maybe you can help find a solution."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ For a basic introduction to climate change and answers to some FAQs, TED has put together a list of [resources](https://countdown.ted.com/get-informed/) and some of their famous talks which can provide you with information and inspiration.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ While we need to start rapidly reducing our reliance on all fossil fuels, this is most urgent for coal - inefficient, heavily polluting, heavy emitting. No new coal is a prerequisite, and accelerating getting rid of coal is priority\n\n_The big contributors_ - Energy companies are obviously the most significant [contributors](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf) to climate change \\[link\\]. Banks and investors have a strong enabling role in the activities in which energy companies can engage \\[link to Finance\\]. Beyond these, several technology solutions that have emerged in recent years emit high levels of emissions, such as data centres for cloud computing, blockchain services, and [ride-hailing apps](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ride-hailing-climate-risks) like Uber. Supply chains that contribute to deforestation also play a role, such as those for palm oil (found in around [50%](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/8-things-know-about-palm-oil) of packaged products in supermarkets).\n\n_Looking out for vulnerable workers_ - Abandoning coal (and other fossil fuels) should not mean abandoning coal workers - companies and governments need to have plans for a just transition for workers to ensure they are guaranteed good jobs that don’t rely on fossil fuels."

Companies based in Asia and companies in the ICT manufacturing sector tend to score lowest on their human rights performance."

content = "It might be a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. They can choose to take a more reasonable approach."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ A great resource with answers to just about everything is [here](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/). The Tax Justice Network has prepared answers to some FAQs [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/faq/), including why this isn’t an issue just for governments. They also have some suggested actions [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/take-action/).\n\n_The most urgent issue_ - Countries across the globe are damaged by the reduced tax revenues they are able to collect from companies. Yet this is a particular problem for developing countries, who are [estimated](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/tackling-global-tax-havens-shaxon.htm) to miss out on around $200bn in corporate tax revenues per year - that’s greater than the amount they receive in development assistance.\n\n_The big contributors to the problem_ - Some media outlets prepare lists of the biggest tax dodgers in their country, including: [Australia](https://www.michaelwest.com.au/top-40-tax-dodgers-2019/), [UK](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6522913/Almost-1-5-biggest-firms-paid-year-5-got-handout-taxman.html), [US]( https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/). A ranking of global corporate tax havens is [here](https://www.corporatetaxhavenindex.org/introduction/cthi-2019-results).\n\n_What can you ask for -_ An important yet basic step a company can take is [country-by-country reporting](https://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/country-by-country/), where it sets out how much tax it pays in each jurisdiction. This simple transparency allows scrutiny of the company’s tax bill. In the UK, businesses can also get certified with a [Fair Tax Mark](https://fairtaxmark.net/) to indicate they’re paying a reasonable rate of tax."
