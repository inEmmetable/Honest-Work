faq_title: Frequently Asked Questions
three_columns___column_one_-_title_: How to make a change?
three_columns___column_one_-_text: Once you’ve identified a change you’d like to try
  and make at your company, where do you begin? Company cultures differ and some issues
  are more sensitive than others, so think carefully about the particular aspects
  of your workplace when seeking to make change. Be aware of the risks of speaking
  up. Need inspiration? Check out what workers have already achieved.
three_columns___column_two_-_title_: Workers changing the world
three_columns___column_two_-_text: History is full of examples of workers coming together
  to stand up for what is right. In 1862, mill workers in Manchester refused to touch
  cotton picked by US slaves. Australian construction workers pioneered “green bans”,
  refusing to build projects that would damage local environments or communities.
  Workers at IBM, Polaroid and others challenged their companies for supplying the
  apartheid South African government.
three_columns___column_three_-_title: Technology
three_columns___column_three-_text: Tech companies operate on the cutting edge of
  innovation, and often venture into new product areas at a pace with which regulation
  cannot be expected to keep up. So it frequently falls to the companies themselves
  to act with care and prudence, and marshall against unforeseen consequences; something
  they have often failed to do.
three_columns_column_three_text: Finance powers the entire economy, and financial
  institutions have major influence over how companies act and what projects get financed.
  It's time they started aligning that influence with the common good.
three_columns_column_one_title: Technology
three_columns_column_one_text: Tech workers have been on the forefront of employee
  activism in recent years. Despite progress, issues with privacy, content moderation
  and an excessive focus on user engagement still plague the industry.
three_columns_column_two_title: Key issues
three_columns_column_two_text: What are the biggest issues facing companies across
  industries that workers can do something about? How's your company faring? Learn
  about your companies' role in relation to climate change, human rights and more.

three_columns_column_one_text_slide_2: The fate of communities around the world are
  shaped in part by the choices energy companies make. Climate change, environmental
  degradation, human rights impacts - energy companies have work to do.
three_columns_column_three_text_slide_2: Many workers join the healthcare industry
  to help make the world a healthier place. Yet practices must change to improve access
  to medicine - especially among the world's poorest.
three_columns_column_three_title_slide_2: Healthcare

  answer: The ["What to change"](https://honestwork.org/what-to-change/overview/)

    as well as some sector-specific challenges. These are a starting point to help
