Even where companies are waking up to the need to reduce their emissions, many \"net zero\" commitments being made leave out important sources of their emissions, or are not backed up by actions or a credible plan.\n\nAll companies should aim to become carbon neutral; this can limit the effects of global warming while driving down the costs of renewables for everyone, saving companies money over time. That said, 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988. Is your company one of them? Perhaps one of their suppliers? Maybe you can help find a solution."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ For a basic introduction to climate change and answers to some FAQs, TED has put together a list of [resources](https://countdown.ted.com/get-informed/) and some of their famous talks which can provide you with information and inspiration. Project Drawdown has put together a comprehensive [guide](https://drawdown.org/publications/climate-solutions-at-work) for what climate conscious employees should demand. [WorkForClimate](https://www.workforclimate.org/post/3-practical-tips-climate-action) and [Planet Groups](https://planetgroups.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/As-an-employee-what-can-I-do-for-Corporate-Climate-Action_EN.pdf) also have some tips.\n\n_The big contributors_ - [Energy companies](https://honestwork.org/what-to-change/energy/) are obviously the most significant [contributors](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf) to climate change. [Banks and investors](https://honestwork.org/what-to-change/finance/) have a strong enabling role in the activities in which energy companies can engage. Beyond these, several technology solutions that have emerged in recent years emit high levels of emissions, such as data centres for cloud computing, blockchain services, and [ride-hailing apps](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ride-hailing-climate-risks) like Uber. Supply chains that contribute to deforestation also play a role, such as those for palm oil (found in around [50%](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/8-things-know-about-palm-oil) of packaged products in supermarkets).\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ While we need to start rapidly reducing our reliance on all fossil fuels, this is most urgent for coal - inefficient, heavily polluting, heavy emitting. No new coal is a prerequisite, and accelerating getting rid of coal is priority.\n\n_Looking out for vulnerable workers_ - Abandoning coal (and other fossil fuels) should not mean abandoning coal workers - companies and governments need to have plans for a \"just transition\" for workers to support them in getting good jobs that don’t rely on fossil fuels."

content = "It might be a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but too often contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nThis problem has been particularly notable during the COVID-19 crisis, as many companies that have benefited from government programmes have been [shown](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-companies-tax-excl/exclusive-u-s-taxpayers-virus-relief-went-to-firms-that-avoided-u-s-tax-idUSKBN2341ZE) to have paid little to no corporation tax.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. It doesn't have to be this way."

content = "Excessive corporate influence over decision-making in politics is a serious problem in many regions of the world. Companies, either directly or through trade associations that they are a member of, donate money to politicians who they perceive as likely to favour their interests (or to push them to do so). Frequently, donations and lobbying activities run [counter](https://politicalaccountability.net/hifi/files/Conflicted-Consequences.pdf) to the declared beliefs of those same companies - for example, companies that are climate champions in public but privately donate funds to climate deniers or lobby to water down public interest regulations.\n\nThere is a question whether corporate money has any place in the political system at all, but there can be little doubt that there is too much of it there at the moment. In the US, the top 10 donors alone in the 2018 election cycle contributed almost half a billion dollars. Had that money been in the hands of workers, political donations may have flowed to politicians more representative of the interests of the population as a whole, rather than those operating in the interests of the company as defined by a minority of executives at the top.\n\nThis is not about influencing whether money flows to liberal or conservative parties; this is about eliminating the ability of companies to undermine the public good and decide the outcomes of elections."

heading = "Prioritising Profits"

content = "Many of the problems we face today are linked in part to the dominance of the “shareholder primacy” model, where companies have myopically sought to maximise profitability to distribute ever larger sums to shareholders, even while negative societal and environmental impacts generated by them have grown. The sheer scale of this problem has been exposed by the coronavirus, where companies who had prioritised shareholder remuneration over all else had no safety cushion, and workers tended to bear the consequences.\n\nIf a company has excess money at the end of the year, distributing it to shareholders should not be its sole priority. It should first seek to eradicate or minimise any harms generated by its business activities. Until it has done that, it hasn’t generated excess money at all - it has simply converted public goods to private gain.\n\nThis is not trying to turn companies into charities or prevent them from making profits; most companies could eliminate their negative impacts while still turning a profit. And if they can’t - if the harm they cause exceeds the profits they make - maybe they shouldn’t be in business at all."

answer = "_What you need to know_ - The idea that a company’s sole purpose is to make profits is summarised in an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/article-15-no-title.html) by economist Milton Friedman in 1970. It has led to a situation where companies are in a position to solve many of the issues that we face while remaining profitable, but choose greater short-term profits instead.
