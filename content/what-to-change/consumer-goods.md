content = "People should never have to work in inhumane conditions just so we can have cheaper clothes, food or gadgets, but this is happening every single day. 1 in 185 people live in modern slavery today, and nothing will change unless the indifference of companies, workers and consumers changes. Looked at another way, all those who participate in the production of goods should have a share in the wealth they generate.\n\nThere are many consumer goods with long supply chains which are known to be significant contributors to human rights abuses or very poor working conditions. Many also contribute to environmental issues such as deforestation. Low-cost clothing, fish and lithium ion batteries for phones and laptops are just some examples of goods with particular high risks."

answer = "* Does your company have a code of conduct for its supply chains? How stringently is it upheld?\n* Can your company trace the raw materials for its products back to their origins (i.e. beyond just their direct supplier)?\n* Does your company’s supply chain operate in any particularly “at risk” regions?"

answer = "_Fashion -_ Documentary “[The True Cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJUQR2oBJv4)” provides a good introduction to some of the issues within the fashion industry. Fashion Revolution has a [manifesto](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/manifesto/) for how the fashion industry needs to change (which workers can sign), and produces a transparency [ranking](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/) of the world’s 250 largest fashion brands every year. KnowTheChain also produces a [ranking](https://knowthechain.org/benchmarks/comparison_tool/6/), focused on actual company behaviour, rather than transparency alone.\n\n_Food and beverages_ - These supply chains cut across human rights, environmental degradation and animal welfare issues. [Fairtrade](https://www.fairtrade.net/issue) explains these issues within a range of these supply chains, while the [BHRRC](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/search-topics) tackles issues including fish and wine. BBFAW compares business practices on animal welfare in an annual [report](https://bbfaw.com/publications/)."

content = "The generally desired goal of a circular economy is some way off, but some product cycles are particularly short-lived, contributing to environmental degradation (not to mention poor consumer outcomes). “Fast fashion” is a particular example of this, while on the other end of the spectrum is the common practice of high-end fashion producers burning unsold stock to preserve their brand value.\n\nFood waste is one of the most urgent problems in this area; around one-third of food produced is thrown away, including by supermarkets and retailers, at a time when so many go hungry.\n\nIn addition to the main product itself, so many products are wrapped in unnecessary packaging, which ends up in landfill or shipped around the world. Our planet is choking on plastics; let’s not use them unless we have to."

content = "It might be a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. They can choose to take a more reasonable approach."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ A great resource with answers to just about everything is [here](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/). The Tax Justice Network has prepared answers to some FAQs [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/faq/), including why this isn’t an issue just for governments. They also have some suggested actions [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/take-action/).\n\n_The most urgent issue_ - Countries across the globe are damaged by the reduced tax revenues they are able to collect from companies. Yet this is a particular problem for developing countries, who are [estimated](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/tackling-global-tax-havens-shaxon.htm) to miss out on around $200bn in corporate tax revenues per year - that’s greater than the amount they receive in development assistance.\n\n_The big contributors to the problem_ - Some media outlets prepare lists of the biggest tax dodgers in their country, including: [Australia](https://www.michaelwest.com.au/top-40-tax-dodgers-2019/), [UK](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6522913/Almost-1-5-biggest-firms-paid-year-5-got-handout-taxman.html), [US]( https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/). A ranking of global corporate tax havens is [here](https://www.corporatetaxhavenindex.org/introduction/cthi-2019-results).\n\n_What can you ask for -_ An important yet basic step a company can take is [country-by-country reporting](https://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/country-by-country/), where it sets out how much tax it pays in each jurisdiction. This simple transparency allows scrutiny of the company’s tax bill. In the UK, businesses can also get certified with a [Fair Tax Mark](https://fairtaxmark.net/) to indicate they’re paying a reasonable rate of tax."
