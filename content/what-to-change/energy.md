While there is increasing awareness of the role energy companies have played in hindering progress on climate change, their broader impacts on communities are still under-appreciated. While renewable energy is our best hope for the future these companies too must urgently improve their human rights practices if they are to retain their moral legitimacy and social licence."

content = "To get the obvious out of the way: yes, energy companies are among the biggest contributors to climate change, and no, it’s not all their fault. Most of the world’s economies are still dependent on fossil fuels to meet their energy needs, and until that is no longer the case companies will exist to meet that demand.\n\nHowever. Companies can choose to support or obstruct the transition to a low-carbon economy, and all too often they have chosen the latter. Suppressing research on the realities of climate change, running disinformation campaigns, fighting measures to curb emissions; these are the ways in which energy companies have helped bring us to the brink of dangerous global warming.\n\nThere are two futures for today’s fossil fuel companies - they can shift their focus and invest in being exclusively renewable energy companies, or they can start to scale down their activities voluntarily, redirecting money that would have been spent on resource exploration to retraining workers for the jobs of our low-carbon future and supporting their other stakeholders."

answer = "* Does your company have a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the very latest? Is the plan detailed and credible?\n* Does your company, either directly or via trade associations, lobby against necessary climate regulations or fund climate change deniers?\n* Is your company continuing to explore for new fossil fuels?"

answer = "_What you need to know_ - For general information on climate change, see here \\[link to General\\]. Policy change to mitigate the effects of climate change is to some extent [inevitable](https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=9833); as physical disasters such as the 2019/20 [Australia fires](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50951043) become more commonplace, inaction will become untenable. But the speed and strength of action is critical, and most energy companies are acting as obstacles. Not only does this mean worse climate change effects down the line, it also means that workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction are more likely to suffer sudden losses of income under policy changes, rather than companies engaging in a managed decline in their extractive operations starting now.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ If the world was to only burn all known fossil fuel reserves, that would already take the planet beyond 2 degrees of global warming, well beyond the[ 1.5 degrees](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) limit needed to avoid some catastrophic consequences. Despite this, fossil fuel expansion continues - pages 4-5 of this [report](https://brightnow.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Church-Investments-in-Major-Oil-Companies-Bright-Now-Report-web.pdf) show how several companies are planning increases in oil and gas production. Fossil fuel companies need to [keep it in the ground](http://keepitintheground.org/).\n\n_What you can ask for -_ One necessary part of a credible climate plan is a minimum price for carbon emitted - see [here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-is-a-carbon-price-and-why-do-we-need-one/) for a good explanation. Companies should publicly support a carbon price of at least $100 per tonne of CO2 in developed countries by 2030 at the latest, and likely much sooner. While many fossil fuel companies have backed a [carbon dividend plan](https://clcouncil.org/our-plan/), the proposed price ($40 per tonne) is too low to justify the roll-back of environmental standards they are seeking alongside it.\n\nA number of companies have declared ambitions to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Such commitments are in theory laudable, but the devil is in the details of how net zero is defined and their plan to get there. This [report](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/tpi/publications/58.pdf?type=Publication) sets out how none of the current 2050 goals are aligned with the Paris Agreement, and what would need to change."

The burning of fossil fuels causes significant air pollution, a leading cause of death in many parts of the world. Chemicals from coal have leaked into groundwater and polluted drinking supplies. Renewable energy sources have also caused their own set of negative impacts, with hydropower dams having led to biodiversity loss, flooding and damaging fish populations."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ RAN [tracks](https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/) bank finance for fossil fuel over time. [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/28243/greenpeace-report-davos-financial-players-pump-us1-4-trillion-into-fossil-fuels/) has shown how many of the world’s biggest banks continue to funnel money into fossil fuels despite public statements that they will help combat climate change. BankTrack has also produced [research](https://www.banktrack.org/campaign/banks_and_human_rights) on the role of banks in relation to human rights.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ If the world was to only burn all known fossil fuel reserves, that would already take the planet beyond 2 degrees of global warming, well beyond the [1.5 degrees](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) limit needed to avoid some catastrophic consequences. Despite this, fossil fuel expansion continues. Banks should not finance the expansion of fossil fuel extraction or infrastructure, whether via project finance (direct financing for a fossil fuel asset) or general corporate support (financing provided to a company overall), for companies expanding fossil fuels."

content = "It might be a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. They can choose to take a more reasonable approach."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ A great resource with answers to just about everything is [here](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/). The Tax Justice Network has prepared answers to some FAQs [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/faq/), including why this isn’t an issue just for governments. They also have some suggested actions [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/take-action/).\n\n_The most urgent issue_ - Countries across the globe are damaged by the reduced tax revenues they are able to collect from companies. Yet this is a particular problem for developing countries, who are [estimated](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/tackling-global-tax-havens-shaxon.htm) to miss out on around $200bn in corporate tax revenues per year - that’s greater than the amount they receive in development assistance.\n\n_The big contributors to the problem_ - Some media outlets prepare lists of the biggest tax dodgers in their country, including: [Australia](https://www.michaelwest.com.au/top-40-tax-dodgers-2019/), [UK](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6522913/Almost-1-5-biggest-firms-paid-year-5-got-handout-taxman.html), [US]( https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/). A ranking of global corporate tax havens is [here](https://www.corporatetaxhavenindex.org/introduction/cthi-2019-results).\n\n_What can you ask for -_ An important yet basic step a company can take is [country-by-country reporting](https://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/country-by-country/), where it sets out how much tax it pays in each jurisdiction. This simple transparency allows scrutiny of the company’s tax bill. In the UK, businesses can also get certified with a [Fair Tax Mark](https://fairtaxmark.net/) to indicate they’re paying a reasonable rate of tax."
