content = "Research and development of life-saving treatments can be a costly business, and so sometimes high drug prices are inevitable. However, it is frequently the case that prices are set with no reference to these costs but rather are set at the maximum the market will bear. Acquiring smaller companies and then increasing the prices of the drugs they sell is also not uncommon. Partially as a result, 34 million Americans have lost a family member or a friend in the last five years, not because the treatment didn't exist, but because they couldn't afford it.\n\nA subset of this issue is how healthcare companies interact with the patent system. Patents exist so that companies can enjoy exclusive rights to the profit of an invention for a limited period after its launch - in most cases 20 years. However, companies often file multiple patents (sometimes over 100 per drug) and make minor adjustments to their product to extend the life of the patent, resulting in prices that are unaffordable for many over an ever longer period of time."

answer = "* Has your company significantly increased the price of life-saving or necessary drugs over the past five years?\n* Does your company publish the formulae or criteria which determine how its drugs are priced?\n* Does your company use equitable pricing to enable access to its drugs in less wealthy countries?\n* Has your company engaged in ‘evergreening’, extending the patent life of its drugs?\n* Does your organisation (and the trade groups which it is a member of) support the five [R.A.I.S.E.](https://www.i-mak.org/mission/) priorities for reform of the patent system?"
question = "Some questions to start with"
[[sections.faq]]
answer = "_What you need to know_ - Different countries around the world have particular needs for certain drugs and differing abilities to afford them; this is why [equitable pricing](https://accesstomedicinefoundation.org/access-to-medicine-index/2018-ranking/subranking/pricing) strategies for drugs is crucial. Yet even in the US -which, as a wealthy country, should be expected to pay higher drug prices than other countries - pays a multiple of the price in comparable countries. Americans spent $535 billion on prescription drugs in 2018, an [increase](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2019/08/30/473911/big-pharma-reaps-profits-hurting-everyday-americans/) of 50% since 2010. The price of long-established drugs such as [insulin](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/opinion/cost-insurance-diabetes-insulin.html) has risen at a rate far greater than inflation, while the amount spent on [medical marketing](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2720029) has also increased substantially.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ The patent system has been abused by companies for a long time; reform is desperately needed both legally and in companies’ practices. Priti Krishtel of I-MAK gives a TED talk on the topic [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/priti_krishtel_why_are_drug_prices_so_high_investigating_the_outdated_us_patent_system); for a deeper dive, check out this [report](https://www.i-mak.org/overpatented-overpriced-excessive-pharmaceutical-patenting-extending-monopolies-driving-drug-prices/)."

content = "Many projects can’t take place without bank financing. Many fossil fuel exploration projects in particular depend on bank financing, and thus banks have a much more direct and contributing role to fossil fuel projects than other actors.\n\n35 global banks have granted $2.7 trillion in financing to fossil fuel companies since the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit global warming. Few banks assess whether they are causing or contributing to human rights breaches. If banks were less indifferent to how their money was used, companies and projects that threatened to harm the public good would struggle to get off the ground."

question = "Some questions to start with"
[[sections.faq]]
answer = "_What you need to know -_ RAN [tracks](https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/) bank finance for fossil fuel over time. [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/28243/greenpeace-report-davos-financial-players-pump-us1-4-trillion-into-fossil-fuels/) has shown how many of the world’s biggest banks continue to funnel money into fossil fuels despite public statements that they will help combat climate change. BankTrack has also produced [research](https://www.banktrack.org/campaign/banks_and_human_rights) on the role of banks in relation to human rights.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ If the world was to only burn all known fossil fuel reserves, that would already take the planet beyond 2 degrees of global warming, well beyond the [1.5 degrees](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) limit needed to avoid some catastrophic consequences. Despite this, fossil fuel expansion continues. Banks should not finance the expansion of fossil fuel extraction or infrastructure, whether via project finance (direct financing for a fossil fuel asset) or general corporate support (financing provided to a company overall), for companies expanding fossil fuels."

content = "It might be a technical and dull concept, but the staggering amount of corporation tax that is stashed in tax havens every year is estimated at up to $600bn a year - an amount that could transform the ability of governments around the world to provide for their citizens and invest in infrastructure and public services. Companies rely on government spending for infrastructure, security, and a healthy and educated workforce, but contribute as little to it as they can.\n\nClosing tax loopholes is undoubtedly governments’ job. Nonetheless, profitable companies spend money on aggressive tax planning (organising their activities intentionally to minimise taxes) rather than contributing to the societies they rely on. They employ armies of accountants and lobbyists to exploit loopholes. They can choose to take a more reasonable approach."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ A great resource with answers to just about everything is [here](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-is-a-tax-haven-offshore-finance-explained/). The Tax Justice Network has prepared answers to some FAQs [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/faq/), including why this isn’t an issue just for governments. They also have some suggested actions [here](https://www.taxjustice.net/take-action/).\n\n_The most urgent issue_ - Countries across the globe are damaged by the reduced tax revenues they are able to collect from companies. Yet this is a particular problem for developing countries, who are [estimated](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/tackling-global-tax-havens-shaxon.htm) to miss out on around $200bn in corporate tax revenues per year - that’s greater than the amount they receive in development assistance.\n\n_The big contributors to the problem_ - Some media outlets prepare lists of the biggest tax dodgers in their country, including: [Australia](https://www.michaelwest.com.au/top-40-tax-dodgers-2019/), [UK](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-6522913/Almost-1-5-biggest-firms-paid-year-5-got-handout-taxman.html), [US]( https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-in-the-first-year-of-the-trump-tax-law/). A ranking of global corporate tax havens is [here](https://www.corporatetaxhavenindex.org/introduction/cthi-2019-results).\n\n_What can you ask for -_ An important yet basic step a company can take is [country-by-country reporting](https://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/country-by-country/), where it sets out how much tax it pays in each jurisdiction. This simple transparency allows scrutiny of the company’s tax bill. In the UK, businesses can also get certified with a [Fair Tax Mark](https://fairtaxmark.net/) to indicate they’re paying a reasonable rate of tax."
