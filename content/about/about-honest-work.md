    Honest Work is founded on the belief that most people, if given the choice, would prefer to do the right thing.

    In our workplaces, that can seem like a luxury that’s not always afforded to us. We have to work to live, and it sometimes feels that truly good corporate citizens are few and far between. Particularly if you want to work for big international companies, it can seem difficult to find ones that aren’t contributing to global problems in some way, be it climate change, human rights abuses or aggressive tax avoidance.

    A big reason for this is that corporate decision-making is primarily set by senior management and shareholders. These groups often have an extreme focus on profitability, and are wealthy enough to avoid dealing with the negative consequences of that focus. These companies would likely be run in a more humane way if workers had more of a say.

    Of course, few enough companies are prepared to give their workers that power, and that’s where Honest Work comes in. We want to help you connect with like-minded colleagues at your company and beyond to change your workplaces for the better and improve the impact companies have on the world.

    We've put together a hub of relevant [information](https://honestwork.org/what-to-change/general/) and resources around how your company might be contributing to some of the problems in the world today. We'll be producing a monthly newsletter on the latest in employee activism, with tips and opportunities to make a difference; subscribe below. We're building an online community for workers who want to make a difference at their company; you can join [here](https://honestwork.org/join/).

    When you’re just one worker at a company that employs thousands, it can seem impossible to change things. But chances are you’re not alone, and together you can make your company, your industry and the world a better place.
