    Once you’ve identified a [change](https://www.honestwork.org/what-to-change/general/) you’d like to try and make at your company, where do you begin?

    Below is a quick step-by-step guide to engaging in workplace advocacy around the kinds of environmental and social issues discussed here. We’ll add more over time. Note that these are only general tips; context is everything. Company cultures differ, some issues are more sensitive than others, so think carefully about the particular aspects of your workplace when seeking to make change. You also need to think carefully about the risks **\[link\]** of speaking up.

    The first step to pushing for change is to start speaking directly with colleagues. Are they aware of the issue? Do they feel strongly about it? Do they agree with your proposed solution? Test your ideas and arguments, be prepared to re-evaluate your stance in response to new information. Encourage them to get active and start talking to others.

    Look if there are existing employee bodies that are working on the issue or related ones: green teams, employee resource groups, staff committees, groups or individuals that run volunteer activities or donation activities. Also seek out staff whose jobs directly overlap with what you’re trying to achieve and those with jobs focused on corporate impact. This should improve your awareness of what the company is already doing, its plans, barriers to more ambitious actions, how you can help.

    While you might want to start with the already converted, broaden your reach as much as possible to get colleagues from different parts of the organisation on board. You don’t want to be dismissed as an unrepresentative minority of employees.

    Bringing colleagues on board should be an ongoing step. The more colleagues you have on your side, the more credible and powerful you all will be.

    Try to get this issue on more colleagues’ radars, including more senior decision-makers. Tteam, department-wide or even company-wide meetings can be suitable venues to raise questions, as can internal online discussion forums.

    This is a way to raise awareness among more colleagues about the issue, who may then choose to get in touch with you. It also signals to management that this is an issue that employees are taking an interest in and creates a subtle pressure to take positive action. At least initially, the focus should be on posing questions (What are we doing on this issue? Could we be doing more?) rather than making demands. Understanding management’s perspective can help you frame your arguments.

    Once you have a sizeable group of co-workers that support your aims, and you have gotten as far as you can from individual, informal critiques of the company’s stance, now is the time to escalate.

    Perhaps the most common way that employees have tended to escalate their concerns is via a petition or open letter, drafted by a subset of workers, circulated among colleagues who can add their name to the list of signatories, and then shared with the CEO or chair of the board of directors. The benefits of this approach is that it gives workers space to articulate their arguments in detail, and demonstrate the breadth of support for their proposals.

    Other measures workers may consider include:

    * Request a town hall:
    * Employee survey: Request
    * Walkout or work to rule/go-slow:

    Undertaking a single action without a broader plan is unlikely to cause a company to act on worker concerns. Don’t treat actions as “one and done”; workers should maintain momentum by taking firmer actions in the absence of progress from the company.
