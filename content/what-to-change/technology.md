So it frequently falls to the companies themselves to act with care and prudence, and marshall against unforeseen consequences; something they have often failed to do.\n\nThe potential ethical issues that tech companies face are so varied and constantly shifting that they cannot all be listed here; what is most needed is for these companies to develop an [approach](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-toolkit/) to innovation with societal welfare at its heart. The [Ethical Explorer Pack](https://ethicalexplorer.org/) has been launched to help all tech workers - engineers, product managers, founders - to grapple with many of these issues."

This creates a range of potential risks about what companies do with that data, how they communicate the uses of that data with data subjects, and how that data is protected.\n\nSo far, many companies’ records on privacy issues have been pretty poor. Lengthy terms of service agreements have sought to insulate companies from risk while leaving them as unfettered as possible and failing to inform consumers of how data would be used. Alongside these pervasive problems, huge data breaches at the likes of Equifax and Facebook have had disastrous consequences for millions of people.\n\nAs the rise in remote working leads to more sensitive data being collected, companies have a role to ensure this is done in an informed, safe and proportionate way."

While the enormous benefits of this should not be forgotten, it has led to a host of problems as well, including giving a platform to disinformation and disturbing content.\n\nThere are no simple solutions to these problems. While highly inappropriate content naturally needs to be policed and taken down, there is a clear [human](https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/) [cost](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cleaners) to those responsible for this task. There are also free speech concerns, as something may be provocative and controversial without meriting censorship. Disinformation is another major issue, as social media sites in particular have become hotbeds of fake news, and have led to a situation where different tribes have completely different versions of reality due to the information they see online.\n\nAt a minimum, companies need to have robust processes in place to ensure these decisions are taken properly. Having teams of content moderators with mere seconds to review flagged posts does not meet this bar. Many of the companies involved are highly profitable and worth billions; they need to invest resources proportionate to the problem they have helped create."

content = "Many tech companies design to maximise “engagement”, the amount of time spent using their products. Obviously making products so good that people will want to use them again and again is generally a good thing; it becomes an issue when they seek to take advantage of human vulnerabilities to manipulate people to continue using products beyond their rational self-interest. As the CEO of Netflix once [said](https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition), its main competitor is not another tech company, but sleep.\n\nThe attention economy has initiated an arms race for people’s attention and time. Unless companies voluntarily step back and impose some self-control, the techniques intended to keep us clicking, buying, watching are only going to become more refined and intrusive. Companies should not seek to maximise the amount of time spent on their sites, but rather should optimise time well spent."

While that position has enabled them to deliver savings to consumers, it has also enabled them to undermine competition by using their platforms to favour their products over others’; collect and hoard data that, were it more freely available, could be used by other companies to deliver improved services and public goods; and ape or acquire start-ups that pose the smallest threat to their dominance.\n\nThis is primarily an issue that regulation should be stepping in to handle, and some tech companies have received 10-figure fines for anti-competitive behaviour. But by the time policymakers step in irreparable damage has already been done, smaller competitors have been put out of business.

Specific practices include companies’ approaches to gathering and hoarding [data](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2017/05/06/data-is-giving-rise-to-a-new-economy); copying competitors’ products and then [privileging](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html) the new product on their platform; introducing [switching costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/switchingcosts.asp) to prevent customers from easily changing service providers.\n\nWhere it would not interfere with users’ privacy, openly sharing data can both create a more level playing field and lead to much more innovation, as knowledge flowing from data would not be restricted to those companies that generate the data. Allowing data portability, such that users can easily export their playlists, social network connections, etc to another service would similarly encourage competition and improve consumer welfare."
